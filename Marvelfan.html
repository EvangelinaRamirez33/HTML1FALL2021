<p>Marvel and Marvel characters have been a love of mine since I was a child. Some of my fondest memories are from the early 70's watching
Lou Ferrigno play the Incredible Hulk and Bill Bixby play Bruce Baner. This character was played by 2 actors since The Hulk was a scientist when he was calm and a monster when he was angry. He was known as Bruce Banner when he was not the Hulk.</p>

		<p>This movie is a new release. The majority of the movie is in a different language so it was mostly subtitled. It is about a Martial-arts master Shang-Chi who confronts the past he thought he left behind when he's drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization.Actors include Simu Liu and Akwafina</p>
