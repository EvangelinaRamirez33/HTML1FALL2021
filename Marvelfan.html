<p>Marvel and Marvel characters have been a love of mine since I was a child. Some of my fondest memories are from the early 70's watching
Lou Ferrigno play the Incredible Hulk and Bill Bixby play Bruce Baner. This character was played by 2 actors since The Hulk was a scientist when he was calm and a monster when he was angry. He was known as Bruce Banner when he was not the Hulk.</p><p style="font-size: 250%></p>"
